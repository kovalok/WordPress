WP StrapFolio - A Showcase Masterpiece. 
Designed for showcasing photo images to make a statement the theme is ideal for all types of websites powered by WordPress.

WP StrapFolio is simple - no special ninja codes or plugins required, simply let the power of WordPress do the work without extra load.
Built on Bootstrap 3 with a touch of old school Bootstrap 2.x and some WP Strap Code know how to make it a perfect fit for both 
desktops and mobile devices alike. We've cleverly incorporated the Hover Drop down menu for large screens and a click to open menu
for small screens for that better user experience.

Bootstrap slider is built in as standard with options to enable/disable it with no extra work on setting it up as once again, we let
WordPress do what it does best - serve your pre-existing content. All you have to do is write your posts, allocate a featured image
and the desired category for the slider, check a box and make a selection in the theme's Customizer and your slider is up and running.

Sticky posts are designed to give you more content highlighting power by displaying a large featured image above the content instead
a half size image beside the content which is left to the standard posts. Again, standard posts are also designed to highlight your
best images and contrasting theme with compelling write up to entice the visitor to read more.

Watch out for the premium version that will add more features, unearth more of WordPress built power to super charge your site!
